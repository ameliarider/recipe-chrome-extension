# Recipe Text Pinner – Chrome Extension

Do you constantly scroll up and down online recipes to check ingredient amounts and then jump back to the instructions? Recipe Text Pinner is here to help.

This simple Chrome extension allows you to copy and paste an ingredient list (or any other text) into a popup box, and pins that text to the top of the page you're viewing, so you can follow the recipe with ease—no more losing your place.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Paste and pin text to the top of any webpage
- ✅ Ideal for recipes: see ingredients and instructions on the same screen
- ✅ Clean, fixed bar that stays visible while you scroll
- ✅ Quick remove button to clear the pinned text

## 🧠 Why This Exists
When following recipes online, ingredients and instructions are often separated by long scrolls and ads. This extension solves the annoying back-and-forth by giving you a quick way to pin the ingredients (or any other notes) right at the top of your browser window.

## 🛠️ How It Works
1. Install the extension in Chrome (see below).
2. Click the extension icon in your browser toolbar.
3. Paste the ingredients list (or any helpful text) into the input box.
4. Click “Pin Text”.
5. Your text will appear in a fixed banner at the top of the current tab.
6. Click the ✖ icon on the banner to remove it.

## 🧩 Install (Unpacked Extension)
1. Clone or download this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/recipe-text-pinner.git`
2. Open Chrome and go to: chrome://extensions/
3. Enable Developer mode (top right toggle)
4. Click "Load unpacked"
5. Select the folder where you saved the extension
6. You're done! Click the 📌 icon to use

## 🔒 Permissions
This extension requires:
- activeTab – to run scripts on the current page
- scripting – to inject the pinned text banner
- tabs – to identify the active browser tab
- host_permissions for all URLs (<all_urls>) – so it works on any recipe site

## ✅ Roadmap / Future Ideas
 - Edit pinned text after pinning
 - Allow multiple pinned notes
 - Option to auto-highlight common ingredients
 - Dark mode for better contrast
